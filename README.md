# Strandberg Project

I've been working in this industry for a few months now, and even if I've been learning a lot every day, there are some things that I want to do to complement my learning, this project is meant to do that.

## What is Strandberg?
Strandberg Guitars, stylised as .strandberg* Guitars, is a Swedish manufacturer of headless electric guitars and basses located in Uppsala, Sweden. Their instruments are recognized for their ergonomic characteristics.

## What do I want to archieve with this project?
1. Learn how to use a web scrapper
    -   I rather die than copy products data by hand
2. Try to learn how this bussiness works
    -   I want to create a CRUD app with multiple functionalities, those being
        -   Some sort of clone of strandbergguitars.com to display every guitar
        -   A filter
        -   Maybe a test that asks you what do you want of a guitar and recommends one bassed on that
        -   Another web page that uses the same server that's separated to the one users use to buy at so that strandberg manufacturers and developers can upload products
